        <p>This relationship was all about trust. You have been my support through thick and thin, and I believe in us. I love how you've always been there for me, and I want that trust and bond to grow even more! Here's my message for you: This relationship has always been about trust, and I want to continue trusting each other no matter what comes our way. Youâ€™ve been my backbone, and I need that strength back to keep going.</p>
