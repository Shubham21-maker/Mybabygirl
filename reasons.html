        <h2>Reason #16</h2>
        <p>Every relationship has its ups and downs, but real love isn’t about running when things get hard. It’s about choosing each other, even on the tough days. I believe that what we have is rare, and I know deep down that love isn’t about finding someone new when things feel difficult—it’s about holding on to the one who’s been there all along. I love you because I know that, no matter what, our story is worth fighting for</p>
